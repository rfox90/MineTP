MineTP
======

MineTP allows you to teleport offline players. Simply go to the position the user should get teleported and run /mtp <player name>


UUIDs
======
This was developed for a modded environment so I neglected to spend much time on UUID support if someone wishes to use this create an issue and i'll sort it.
